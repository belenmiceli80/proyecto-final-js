                        <p>Londres, 1932. Un peque√±o negocio de venta de estampillas es la entrada a la Academia Belladonna, una escuela de asesinos. Hasta all√≠ llega el joven Duncan Dix para aprender las t√©cnicas que le permitan vengar la muerte de sus padres. Como un h√©roe tr√°gico pose√≠do por el pasado, el temperamental muchacho es guiado por el af√°n de justicia. Mientras dedica las primeras horas del d√≠a a doblar camisas en una gran tienda, a partir del anochecer se re√∫ne con el resto de los aprendices en las aulas de la Academia Belladonna, dispersas en distintos enclaves de la ciudad, lugares propicios para ejercitarse en un tipo diferente de asesinato.</p>
                        <p>Entre venenos, armas de fuego y cerbatanas, descubre el v√≠nculo entre el crimen y la filatelia, conoce los riesgos del oficio, se asoma a la seducci√≥n y al amor y aprende a matar. Mientras avanza hacia la venganza fat√≠dica, un cuarto cerrado lo espera: la habitaci√≥n clausurada del pasado familiar.</p>

                        <p>The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn‚Äôt drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.</p>
                        <p>Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs‚Äîand wants‚Äîto avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby‚Äôs resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis‚Äôs apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.</p>

                        <p>Cath is a Simon Snow fan. Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan.... But for Cath, being a fan is her life‚Äîand she's really good at it. She and her twin, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it's what got them through their mother leaving.</p>
                        <p>Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fanfiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere. Cath's sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can't let go. She doesn't want to.</p>
                        <p>Now that they're going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She's got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend; a fiction-writing professor who thinks fanfiction is the end of the civilized world; a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... and she can't stop worrying about her dad, who's loving and fragile and has never really been alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</p>

                        <p>Lily hasn‚Äôt always had it easy, but that‚Äôs never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She‚Äôs come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up ‚Äî she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily‚Äôs life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.</p>
                        <p>Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He‚Äôs also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt. Lily can‚Äôt get him out of her head. But Ryle‚Äôs complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‚Äúno dating‚Äù rule, she can‚Äôt help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.</p>
                        <p>As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan ‚Äî her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</p>

The first step is admitting, right? Except, I can never admit it to him because he clearly doesn‚Äôt see me that way, and the last thing I want is for things to get weird between us.</p>
                        <p>Nothing but good old-fashioned, no-touching-the-sexiest-man-alive, platonic friendship for us! Everything is exactly how I like it! Yes. Good. (I‚Äôm not crying, I‚Äôm just peeling an onion.)
                        </p>
                        <p>Our friendship is going swimmingly until I accidentally spill my beans to a reporter over too much tequila, and now the world seems to think me and Nathan belong together. Oh, and did I mention we have to date publicly for three weeks until after the Super Bowl because we signed a contract with...oops, forgot I can‚Äôt tell anyone about that!</p>
                        <p>Bottom line is, now my best friend is smudging all the lines and acting very un-platonic, and I‚Äôm just trying to keep my body from bursting into flames every time he touches me.
                        </p>
                        <p>How am I going to make it through three weeks of fake dating Nathan without anything changing between us? Especially when it almost-sort-a-kinda seems like he‚Äôs fighting for a completely different outcome?</p>

What should be a quick trip to recharge the town‚Äôs ley lines and make an appearance at the annual fall festival turns disastrously wrong. With one calamity after another striking Rhys, Vivi realizes her silly little Ex Hex may not have been so harmless after all.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly, Graves Glen is under attack from murderous wind-up toys, a pissed off ghost, and a talking cat with some interesting things to say.

She‚Äôs charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley & Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.</p>
                        <p>Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they‚Äôve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There‚Äôs the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can‚Äôt let Joshua beat her at anything‚Äîespecially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.</p>
                        <p>If Lucy wins this game, she‚Äôll be Joshua‚Äôs boss. If she loses, she‚Äôll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she‚Äôs got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she‚Äôs got Joshua Templeman all wrong.</p>
                        <p>Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn‚Äôt hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn‚Äôt hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</p>

                        <p>As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.</p>
                        <p>That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.</p>

                        <p>I have found rock bottom. It‚Äôs here, moving in with my older brother because I‚Äôm too broke to afford to live on my own. But that‚Äôs okay because we‚Äôve always been close and I think I‚Äôm going to have fun living with him again.
                        </p>
                        <p>That is until I meet Cooper‚Ä¶</p>
                        <p>Turns out, my brother has very strong opinions on the idea of me dating his best friend and is dead set against it. According to him, Cooper is everything I should stay away from: flirtatious, adventurous, non-committal, and freaking hot. (I added that last part because I feel like you need the whole picture.) My brother is right, though. I should stay away from Cooper James and his pretty blue eyes. He‚Äôs the opposite of what I need right now.</p>
                        <p>Nah‚ÄîWho am I kidding? I‚Äôm going for him.</p>

                        <h4>Elena Armas</h4>
                        <p class="resaltar">A wedding. A trip to Spain. The most infuriating man. And three days of pretending. Or in other words, a plan that will never work.</p>
                        <p>Catalina Mart√≠n, finally, not single. Her family is happy to announce that she will bring her American boyfriend to her sister‚Äôs wedding. Everyone is invited to come and witness the most magical event of the year.</p>
                        <p>That would certainly be tomorrow‚Äôs headline in the local newspaper of the small Spanish town I came from. Or the epitaph on my tombstone, seeing the turn my life had taken in the span of a phone call.</p>
                        <p>Four weeks wasn‚Äôt a lot of time to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic‚Äìfrom NYC and all the way to Spain‚Äìfor a wedding. Let alone, someone eager to play along my charade. But that didn‚Äôt mean I was desperate enough to bring the 6‚Äô4 blue eyed pain in my ass standing before me.</p>
                        <p>Aaron Blackford. The man whose main occupation was making my blood boil had just offered himself to be my date. Right after inserting his nose in my business, calling me delusional, and calling himself my best option. See? Outrageous. Aggravating. Blood boiling. And much to my total despair, also right. Which left me with a surly and extra large dilemma in my hands. Was it worth the suffering to bring my colleague and bane of my existence as my fake boyfriend to my sister‚Äôs wedding? Or was I better off coming clean and facing the consequences of my panic induced lie?</p>
                        <p>Like my abuela would say, que dios nos pille confesados.</p>

                        <p>She‚Äôs a romantic at heart, living in the most unromantic of worlds . . .</p>
                        <p>Nicknamed Sweet Abelli for her docile nature, Elena smiles on cue and has a charming response for everything. She‚Äôs the favored daughter, the perfect mafia principessa . . . or was.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, all she can see in the mirror‚Äôs reflection is blood staining her hands like crimson paint.</p>
                        <p>They say first impressions are everything . . .</p>
                        <p>In the murky waters of New York‚Äôs underworld, Elena‚Äôs sister is arranged to marry Nicolas Russo. A Made Man, a boss, a cheat‚Äîeven measured against mafia standards. His reputation stretches far and wide and is darker than his black suits and ties. After his and Elena‚Äôs first encounter ends with an accidental glare on her part, she realizes he‚Äôs just as rude as he is handsome.</p>
                        <p>She doesn‚Äôt like the man or anything he stands for, though that doesn‚Äôt stop her heart from pattering like rain against glass when he‚Äôs near, nor the shiver that ghosts down her spine at the sound of his voice.</p>
                        <p>And he‚Äôs always near. Telling her what to do. Making her feel hotter than any future brother-in-law should. Elena may be the Sweet Abelli on the outside, but she‚Äôs beginning to learn she has a taste for the darkness, for rough hands, cigarettes, and whiskey-colored eyes. Having already escaped one scandal, however, she can hardly afford to be swept up in another.</p>
                        <p>Besides, even if he were hers, everyone knows you don‚Äôt fall in love with a Made Man . . . right?</p>

                        <p>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in‚Ä¶well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fianc√© is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she‚Äôs managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she‚Äôs forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.</p>
                        <p>Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren‚Äôt affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there‚Äôs an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.</p>
                        <p>Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn‚Äôt mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</p>

                        <p>It‚Äôs been years since seventeen-year-old Becca Hart believed in true love. But when her former best friend teases her for not having a boyfriend, Becca impulsively pretends she‚Äôs been secretly seeing someone.</p>
                        <p>Brett Wells has it all. Being captain of the football team and one of the most popular guys in school, he should have no problem finding someone to date, but he‚Äôs always been more focused on his future than who to bring to prom. When he overhears Becca‚Äôs lie, Brett decides to step in and be her mystery guy. It‚Äôs the perfect solution: he gets people off his back for not dating and she can keep up the ruse.</p>
                        <p>Acting like the perfect couple isn‚Äôt easy though, especially when you barely know the other person. But with Becca still picking up the pieces from when her world was blown apart years ago and Brett just barely holding his together now, they begin to realize they have more in common than they ever could have imagined. When the line between real and pretend begins to blur, they are forced to answer the question: is this fake romance the realest thing in either of their lives?</p>
