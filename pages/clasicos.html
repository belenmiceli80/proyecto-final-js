                        <p>Londres, 1932. Un peque√±o negocio de venta de estampillas es la entrada a la Academia Belladonna, una escuela de asesinos. Hasta all√≠ llega el joven Duncan Dix para aprender las t√©cnicas que le permitan vengar la muerte de sus padres. Como un h√©roe tr√°gico pose√≠do por el pasado, el temperamental muchacho es guiado por el af√°n de justicia. Mientras dedica las primeras horas del d√≠a a doblar camisas en una gran tienda, a partir del anochecer se re√∫ne con el resto de los aprendices en las aulas de la Academia Belladonna, dispersas en distintos enclaves de la ciudad, lugares propicios para ejercitarse en un tipo diferente de asesinato.</p>
                        <p>Entre venenos, armas de fuego y cerbatanas, descubre el v√≠nculo entre el crimen y la filatelia, conoce los riesgos del oficio, se asoma a la seducci√≥n y al amor y aprende a matar. Mientras avanza hacia la venganza fat√≠dica, un cuarto cerrado lo espera: la habitaci√≥n clausurada del pasado familiar.</p>

                        <p>The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn‚Äôt drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.</p>
                        <p>Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs‚Äîand wants‚Äîto avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby‚Äôs resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis‚Äôs apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.</p>

                        <p>Cath is a Simon Snow fan. Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan.... But for Cath, being a fan is her life‚Äîand she's really good at it. She and her twin, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it's what got them through their mother leaving.</p>
                        <p>Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fanfiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere. Cath's sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can't let go. She doesn't want to.</p>
                        <p>Now that they're going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She's got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend; a fiction-writing professor who thinks fanfiction is the end of the civilized world; a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... and she can't stop worrying about her dad, who's loving and fragile and has never really been alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</p>

                        <p>Lily hasn‚Äôt always had it easy, but that‚Äôs never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She‚Äôs come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up ‚Äî she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily‚Äôs life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.</p>
                        <p>Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He‚Äôs also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt. Lily can‚Äôt get him out of her head. But Ryle‚Äôs complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‚Äúno dating‚Äù rule, she can‚Äôt help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.</p>
                        <p>As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan ‚Äî her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</p>

                        <p>Alannah Sullican met Dominic Collazo when she was only in the fifth grade. She knew him when the other kids called him names and made fun of him for having a criminal for a father. She knew him when he was first introduced to the mob by that same criminal father, and she fell in love with him when she was just a teenager ‚Ä¶ just in time for her family to pack up and move away from the city and boy she loved.</p>
                        <p>But, Alannah is back now, and after ten long years, Dominic Collazo is all grown up. He is larger than life and every woman‚Äôs fantasy as a rich casino owner with the looks of a Greek god, and an alpha male persona to die for. He‚Äôs also a captain in the notorious Giordano crime family.</p>
                        <p>When the two of them meet again, Alannah has no idea that her reunion with Dominic will also be her biggest curse. As drama ensues and bullets fly, Alannah has to ask herself if Dominic is worth all the trouble that comes with him.</p>
                        <p>Would you risk everything to be with the love of your life, even if he‚Äôs the mafia‚Äôs newest KINGPIN?</p>

The cherry on top is finding her boyfriend in bed with another woman. She needs a break, and sanctuary comes in the form of Rosemont, a gorgeous estate in California promising rest and relaxation.</p>
                        <p>Then she meets the owner‚Äôs equally gorgeous grandson, ex‚Äìhockey player and current recluse Lucian Osmond, and she sees her own pain and yearning reflected in his eyes.</p>
                        <p>He‚Äôs charming when he wants to be but also secretive and gruff, with protective walls as thick as Emma‚Äôs own. Despite a growing attraction, they avoid each other.

                        <p>But then there‚Äôs an impromptu nighttime skinny-dip, and Lucian‚Äôs luscious homemade tarts and cream cakes start arriving at Emma‚Äôs door, tempting her to taste life again‚Ä¶</p>
                        <p>In trying to stay apart, they only grow closer‚Äîand their broken pieces just might fit together and make them whole.</p>
